  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - packages/pal/assets/images/logo.png

    - packages/pal/assets/images/create_helper.png

    - packages/pal/assets/images/create_helper/types/helper_type_fullscreen.png
    - packages/pal/assets/images/create_helper/types/helper_type_simple.png
    - packages/pal/assets/images/create_helper/types/helper_type_update.png

    - packages/pal/assets/images/create_helper/themes/black/helper_theme_black_fullscreen.png
    - packages/pal/assets/images/create_helper/themes/black/helper_theme_black_simple.png
    - packages/pal/assets/images/create_helper/themes/black/helper_theme_black_update.png

# For details regarding assets in packages, see
# https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
#
# An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
# https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
# To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
# in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
# "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
# list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
# example:
# fonts:
#   - family: Schyler
#     fonts:
#       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
#       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
#         style: italic
#   - family: Trajan Pro
#     fonts:
#       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
#       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
#         weight: 700
